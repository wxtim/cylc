            The workflow to interrogate.
        task:
            The name of the task to query.
        point:
            The cycle point.
        offset:
            The offset between the cycle this xtrigger is used in and the one
            it is querying for as an ISO8601 time duration.
            e.g. PT1H (one hour).
        status:
            The task status required for this xtrigger to be satisfied.

        cylc_run_dir:
            Alternate cylc-run directory, e.g. for another user.
