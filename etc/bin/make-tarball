USAGE: make-tarball

Roll an archive of the clean cylc source tree from the head of the
current repository branch.

The version string, from "cylc --version",  is generated by 'git describe'
which references (a) the latest annotated tag, (b) the number of commits
since the tag, and (c)the hash ID of the latest commit.

How to apply an annotated tag to the repository:
 % git tag -a x.y.z -m 'Official cylc-x.y.z release.'
